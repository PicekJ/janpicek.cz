My name is Jan Picek and I’m a student of **mathematical informatics** at **Masaryk University** in **Brno**, Czech Republic, but my home is in České Budějovice.

I chose to study computer science, because my dad has engineer degree in cybernetics and he's been a big influence. I guess that computer science is pretty much in our whole family. Even my grandfather worked as data analyst (he used to use punched cards to code which I find quite amazing) and my brother is studying for Master's degree in bioinformatics at Charles University.

Even tho I know that I want to study computer science I couldn't decide what specialization to take for a long time. I always seek for the bad sides of it and switches to different field. Recently a lot of AI projects blew up and I feel like it might be a good field to explore and study, so I decided to take mathematical informatics because maths is important for machine learning and it is very flexible if I change my mind.

I find reading as a tool that broadens one's view of the world and changes the way of thinking. Having said that, I don't read as much as I'd like to, mainly because simpler entertainment in the form of pictures and videos wins out in my spare time. My taste of literature is still very variable, but I've been enjoying Haruki Murakami lately.

I am not much of an athlete, but I used to go to an athletics club. Since then I've been enjoying **trail and long distance running**. Sometimes I go to the gym and I enjoy walks with music or an episode of some quality podcast in my earbuds.

I love music. My favourite genres are **Rock** and **Jazz** and everything in between. I play the trumpet and I have been toying with the idea of joining a band or orchestra for some time. I also really enjoy going to classical music concerts.

I'm interested in a lot of things, but I struggle to stick with one hobby. After a while I get tired of it and start doing something else. Because of this, I am unable to get into the complexities of the concern. This problem of mine is a [partial reason](About Website) why I started writing this website - to organize my life a little.
